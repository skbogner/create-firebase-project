# Scaffold Firebase

Scaffolding for Firebase projects.

This sets your project up with:
- `babel`
- `eslint`
- `jest`
- A sample cloud function.
- A sample `jest` test suite.

It's meant to provide a more sane starting point for your firebase projects than the `firebase` cli.

## Usage

```
> mkdir project_name && cd $_
> firebase init
  // follow instructions
  // and be sure to select JavaScript as language
> scaffold-firebase
```
